# Instagram_Explorer
It is an agent that is able to navigate through Instagram profiles autonomously,
without authentication.
During the exploration all images of the instagram profile are saved.
There are three ways of exploration:

- Start from the first inserted profile and explore by related profiles;
- Start from the first inserted profile and explore by progressive owner id;
- Collect a list of user_name - owner_id starting from the last collected owner_id
or from a owner_id inserted by the user;

Instagram  can block you during the exploration process bacuse of 
a high amount of web requests.
A mechanism to renew the ip address of your ISP is implemented.
 
 - A short video will be available in some days...
