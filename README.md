# Instagram_Explorer
It is an agent that is able to navigate through Instagram profiles autonomously,
without authentication.
During the exploration all images of the instagram profiles are saved.
There are three ways of exploration:

- Start from the first inserted profile and explore by related profiles;
- Start from the first inserted profile and explore by progressive owner id;
- Collect a list of user_name - owner_id starting from the last collected owner_id
or from a owner_id inserted by the user;

Instagram  can block you during the exploration process because of 
an high amount of web requests.
Some procedures to renew the ip address of your ISP are implemented:
 - Automatic renew in case of Mobile ISP connected using Android SmarthPhone;
 - Automatic renew in case of Fiber connection using a Technicolor Router;
 - Manual ip address renewal;
